<!--<img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/setmyselfteaser_small.jpg" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Set Myself On Fire" />--><strong>"Rumble", a 3-song 12" EP, was released by <a href="http://www.finrecords.com">Fin Records</a> in 2013.</strong> To support this record with live shows, I revived my 90s band name <a href="http://www.facebook.com/endinos.earthworm">"Endino's Earthworm".</a> With me onstage are drummer Johnny G and bassist Sam MacDonald, who played with me in Kandi Coded, 2006-2010. On second guitar we had Bubba DuPree (from the DC band Void) sitting in for several months; now we have Chris Johnson, formerly with Zeke. In 2014 we have begun recording a new Endino's Earthworm record which will probably be titled "Set Myself On Fire".</p>

<!--<img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/PFEsmall.gif" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Permanent Fatal Error" />--><strong>My third record <a href="http://jackendino.bandcamp.com">"Permanent Fatal Error"</a></strong> was released by Wondertaker in January 2006, to very kind <a href="pfe.html">reviews.</a> It is now available via <a href="http://jackendino.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> as well as thru iTunes. Part of it has drummer Barrett Martin and bassists Rob Skinner and Pat Pedersen backing me; part of it has Josh Sinder and Alex Sibbald, who were the drums/bass for the Accused circa 1991; a few tunes have me on all instruments. In October 2005 I did a West Coast tour featuring the amazing <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dirty-power/id119005032">Dirty Power</a> as my backing band.</p>

            <!--<img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/wormsmall.gif" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Earthworm" />--><strong>"Endino's Earthworm" was the full title of a record released in 1992</strong> by Cruz Records. It was really my second solo album, but because Skin Yard had just broken up, I imagined this could be my new band name, somewhat like "Frampton's Camel" or "Tony McPhee's Groundhogs." I played everything on two songs, but for the rest I had drummers Barrett Martin and Greg Gilmore, and bassists Rob Skinner and Daniel House. However the live Earthworm "Mk I" lineup (me, Barrett, and Rob Skinner, later Pat Pedersen) only played a few shows, because "Seattle" exploded and my production career took off.</p>

            <!--<img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/anglesmall.gif" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Angle of Attack" />--><strong><a href="http://jackendino.bandcamp.com">"Angle Of Attack"</a>, my first solo album, was released in 1989 by Bobok, Ltd,</strong> a part of the Toxic Shock label. A cassette-only version was released by Joe Ross' Endgame Records a few years earlier. This was truly a "solo" album as I played almost everything, although Greg Gilmore (Mother Love Bone) drums on one song, and contributes percussion. <strong>It is now remastered and reissued exclusively via <a href="http://jackendino.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> with additional bonus tracks.</strong></p>
