<!--<img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/setmyselfteaser_small.jpg" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Set Myself On Fire" />--><strong>"Rumble", a 3-song 12" EP, was released by <a href="http://www.finrecords.com">Fin Records</a> in 2013.</strong> To support this record with live shows, I revived my 90s band name <a href="http://www.facebook.com/endinos.earthworm">"Endino's Earthworm".</a> With me onstage are drummer Johnny G and bassist Sam MacDonald, who played with me in Kandi Coded, 2006-2010. On second guitar we had Bubba DuPree (from the DC band Void) sitting in for several months; now we have Chris Johnson, formerly with Zeke. In 2014 we have begun recording a new Endino's Earthworm record which will probably be titled "Set Myself On Fire".</p>

<!--<img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/PFEsmall.gif" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Permanent Fatal Error" />--><strong>My third record <a href="http://jackendino.bandcamp.com">"Permanent Fatal Error"</a></strong> was released by Wondertaker in January 2006, to very kind <a href="pfe.html">reviews.</a> It is now available via <a href="http://jackendino.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> as well as thru iTunes. Part of it has drummer Barrett Martin and bassists Rob Skinner and Pat Pedersen backing me; part of it has Josh Sinder and Alex Sibbald, who were the drums/bass for the Accused circa 1991; a few tunes have me on all instruments. In October 2005 I did a West Coast tour featuring the amazing <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dirty-power/id119005032">Dirty Power</a> as my backing band.</p>

            <!--<img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/wormsmall.gif" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Earthworm" />--><strong>"Endino's Earthworm" was the full title of a record released in 1992</strong> by Cruz Records. It was really my second solo album, but because Skin Yard had just broken up, I imagined this could be my new band name, somewhat like "Frampton's Camel" or "Tony McPhee's Groundhogs." I played everything on two songs, but for the rest I had drummers Barrett Martin and Greg Gilmore, and bassists Rob Skinner and Daniel House. However the live Earthworm "Mk I" lineup (me, Barrett, and Rob Skinner, later Pat Pedersen) only played a few shows, because "Seattle" exploded and my production career took off.</p>

A cassette-only version was released by Joe Ross' Endgame Records a few years earlier. This was truly a "solo" album as I played almost everything, although Greg Gilmore (Mother Love Bone) drums on one song, and contributes percussion. <strong>It is now remastered and reissued exclusively via <a href="http://jackendino.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> with additional bonus tracks.</strong></p>
            
            
                    <h1>Jack's Other Bands (1984-present)</h1>
            
            <p><img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/rocketsurgery_small.jpg" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Rocket Surgery" /><strong><a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/rocketsurgerysounds">Rocket Surgery</a> (2012 up to the present)</strong> I currently moonlight on bass with this Seattle combo. The drummer is Scott Rockwell, AKA Norman Scott from Skin Yard and Gruntruck, an old friend. The band is fronted by dual songstresses Frankie O and Allison Maryatt, who both play guitar and sing in harmony. Imagine the Breeders with more muscle behind them! Our in-joke that it's "Estrogen Rock" derives from a whimsical discussion I had with Kim Thayil many years ago. This band is great fun for me (and audiences!) though I am not doing any singing or songwriting here.</p>
            
            <p><img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/kandigiftsmall.gif" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Fell For The Gift" /><strong>Kandi Coded (2006-2010)</strong> The best live rock band I'd played in up to that point, Kandi Coded featured powerhouse drummer Johnny G, bassist Sam MacDonald, myself on lead guitar and backing vocals, and our friend, legendary snowboarder Jamie Lynn, on rhythm guitar and lead vocals. We made two records that were released by the Volcom record label, and did several very amusing winter tours in the western half of the US, plus a west coast tour with Turbonegro. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/time-wasted-is-not-wasted/id475658159">"Time Wasted Is Not Wasted Time"</a> was released on CD in 2007; I recorded it but only contribute guitar to four tunes, as the record was almost finished when I joined. For the final record, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fell-for-the-gift/id347233106">"Fell For The Gift"</a> (vinyl and download, 2010), I was a co-songwriter and full band member, and play lots of gnarly guitar and sing lead on two songs.</p>
            
            <p><img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/slippage_small.jpg" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Slippage" /><strong><a href="http://slippagemusic.com">Slippage</a> (2006-2009) </strong> This power trio marked my return to drumming after 15 years, and featured Allison Maryatt on vocals and guitar, and Gary King on lead guitar. We recorded one album, "Tectonica". In our final year, I moved to bass, and Scott Rockwell took over drum duties.</p>
            
            <p><img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/upwell2_small.gif" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Upwell Number 9" /><strong>In 2003-2004 I was "perma-temp" bassist for <a href="http://www.upwell.org">Upwell</a></strong>, an excellent band whose debut CD I had recorded, though not played on. We did record one 4-song EP, "Number Nine," while I played with them. I recently recorded their 2008 CD, "Sell The Sky."</p>
            
            <p><img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/wwc_small.jpg" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Wellwater Conspiracy" /><strong>In 2000-2001, I played bass with Wellwater Conspiracy</strong> for several shows, one of which was opening for Pearl Jam at the Seattle Arena (Nov 6, 2000), another was Terrastock in Seattle, and another was opening for Guided By Voices in New York. The only WWC recording I appear on is a "live" B-side of one 7 inch. This was my third band with Matt Cameron on drums. A permutation of the band with Dan Peters drumming (when Matt was out with Pearl Jam) was called Brotherhood of the Electric.</p>
            
            <p><img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/knucksmall.gif" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Inside The Eye" /><strong>Skin Yard (1985-1991) </strong> Six albums, six drummers, a continent-wide swath of grunge-punk-psych-metal destruction! There's now an "official" <a href="http://www.skin-yard.com">Skin Yard site</a> managed by bassist/co-founder Daniel House, and for posterity's sake there's still my rather quaint, obsolete <a href="skinyard/index.html">old site.</a> The key members were House and myself, as well as singer Ben McMillan, who went on to greater notoriety with Gruntruck but is now sadly deceased.</p>
            
            <p><img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/ck5_small.jpg" class="album-thumbnails" alt="Crypt Kicker Five" /><strong>Crypt Kicker Five (1986-1990) </strong> Few outside Seattle now remember this brilliantly quirky garage band, but I played drums for them for five years, and we played LOTS of shows in the Pacific NW, but those were the grunge years and we did not fit the prevailing narrative, self-describing our music as "Mediterranean Techno-Surf". We recorded an album ("Previously Un") but never bothered to release it until years later in a very limited run. There was a self-released cassette, one 7 inch on C/Z Records, and a couple compilation tracks. Rhonda Pelikan - guitar, vocals; Jamie Caffery - bass, vocals; Chip Doring - guitar, vocals; myself - drums.</p> 
            
            <p><strong>Karl Reimer Quintet (1985-1986) </strong> An outright jazz band, featuring Matt Cameron on drums, Lu Evers on sax/clarinet, Scott Brown on trombone, Jim Knodle on trumpet, and myself on bass. We worked up a full set of be-bop standards (Monk, Ellington, etc) and several band originals, and played six rather odd but enjoyable shows, some of which I recorded. I wrote my only song ever on musical staff paper with all four instrument parts scored out carefully, titled "Circumlocution".</p>
            
            <p><strong>Actual Size (1984-1985) </strong> An eccentric, enjoyable combo for whom I played bass for a while; we played a number of shows. Some 4-track recordings, but nothing officially released. Lu "Jubal" Evers - reeds, vocals; Garfield Hamilton - drums, vocals; Teresa "Serenity" B - percussion; Steve "Humility" DeTray (ex-Ant Trip Ceremony) - guitar, vocals.</p>
            
            <p><img src="http://endino.com/albumcovers/75x75/ones_small.jpg" class="album-thumbnails" alt="The Ones" /><strong>Terry Lee Hale &amp; The Ones (1984-1987)</strong> Myself on bass, Chris Adams on drums, and Terry Lee Hale on guitar, vocals and songwriting. This was completely Terry Lee's thing, a kind of punk/bluegrass/kitchen-sink power trio. When I learned ten of his songs at our first rehearsal, it was obvious I had to play with them, and I continued to even after co-founding Skin Yard a couple months later. For about a year I was actually playing gigs in three bands: The Ones (on bass), Skin Yard (on guitar), and Crypt Kicker Five (on drums), plus working at the newly-opened Reciprocal Recording. There's an unreleased album's worth of excellent basement recordings I made with The Ones. We played a lot of shows in a short time, but again, we did not fit the emerging grunge narrative. There were several "reunion" gigs, the last in 1995.</p>
            
            <p><em>For those who are curious (...myself included!), I try to maintain a <a href="jemusicdiscog.html">full list of all the records I have played or sang on</a>, including lots of "guest appearances".</em></p>
